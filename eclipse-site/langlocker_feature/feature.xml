      Blocks unwanted input language switches (like English to Russian) while working in IDE.

In order to lock the current input language, run the &apos;Lock/unlock input language&apos; command, or click on the corresponding button on the top panel, which looks like a lock with &apos;EN&apos; chracters on it. In order to unlock, do the same thing again.
